- **No More Mr. Nice Guy by Robert A. Glover** - Jan 2024
    - I the vein of dating and relationships agian. Little dated, but interesting. Lot of things to think on from this one. 
- **How to Be Confident by James Smith** - Jan 2024
    - My first ever audiobook listen. Yes I'm pretty late to the party. The book itself was ok. Some interesting snippets in there. But the bulk was a long list of loosly related heuristics and pop-sci. Realyl like the guys channel on Youtube though. 
- **Models by Mark Manson** - Late 2023
    - More Manson. This is his first book (and you can tell a little). Interesting view on the world of dating. First half is pretty cool, a lot of focus on the self and getting over your own idiocracies. Second half gets a little to PUA for me. 
- **The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson** - Late 2023
    - Actually quite enjoyed this. Is a really easy read, with some interesting thoughts on how you can lead your life on your own terms. Writing this a few months after reading, so a bit iffy on the details. Well worth the read though.
